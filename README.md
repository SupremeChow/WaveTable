# WaveTable
This application was a final project for Database Management class (despite minimal database usage). The goal was to simply implement a database(SQLite) into a simple audio program to create and store wavetables. The program is built on the JUCE api (not included) which handled alot of the heavy lifting, and implemented SQLite (also not included). Basic audio buffering and some components were referenced from online sources like Youtube. Basic functionality of the app (from what I remember), the user can choose between sine/square/triangle wave and different bit depths, and play on a virtual keyboard. SQLite would handle populating wavetables and switching between them when the user change settings. Because the application was hacked together as proof of conecpt, the program may not be the most ideal VST or use of SQLite.
